## About me
Throughout my professional career in IT (tech support, IT infrastructures maintaince), I have always looked with interest at software development.
Over the past couple of years, I have been taking steps to change my profession — to enter to frontend development. Also try to keep abreast of industry — watch some videos, read articles, listen podcasts etc.
  
I am currently taking a _"JavaScript/Front-end"_ course at Rolling Scopes School. Spend the most of my free time on this and very motivated for results.
  
I don't have much experience yet, but I already understand that I'm most interested in JS. At the end of the current course, as a continuation of my education, I planned to delve into data structures and algorithms.

## Skills
* HTML5, CSS3 (Fundamentals)
* JS (Fundamentals)
* Git

Overall, thanks to my profession, I have good knowledge in computer science, which definitely helps me with current learning.

## Code examples

**Task:**

Write a function ```camelize(str)``` that converts strings like _‘my-short-string’_ to _‘myShortString’_ — hyphens are removed, and all words after them get a capital letter.

**Solution:**
```javascript
function camelize(str) {
      let arrayStrings = str.split('-');
      
      let camelizedString = arrayStrings.map( (item, index) => {
        if (index === 0) return item;
    
        return item[0].toUpperCase() + item.slice(1);
      }).join('');
    
      return camelizedString;
    }
```
